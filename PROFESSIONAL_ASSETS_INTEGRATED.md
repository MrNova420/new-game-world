# ✨ Professional Assets Integration Complete - v5.0.0

## Overview

Dynasty of Emberveil now uses **200+ professional 3D models** from high-quality asset packs instead of demo placeholder assets!

## Problem Solved

**Previous Issue:** Game was loading old demo assets (Soldier.glb, RobotExpressive.glb, DamagedHelmet.glb) from Three.js examples instead of the professional asset packs that were purchased and stored in the repository.

**Solution:** Extracted and integrated all professional asset packs from the "assets and models" directory into the game's asset loading system.
