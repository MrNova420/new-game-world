## üìú Lore & Story

### The Age of Creation

In the beginning, the world of Emberveil was formless chaos. The **Five Primordial Gods** - Luminos (Light), Umbros (Shadow), Pyros (Fire), Aqualis (Water), and Terros (Earth) - shaped the realm from void. They created the first beings and imbued the land with magic.

### The First Dynasty

The **Dynasty of Emberveil** was established by King Alderan the Wise, uniting all races under one banner. For 1,000 years, peace reigned. The capital, **Everlight City**, floated above the world as a symbol of unity.

### The Cataclysm

500 years ago, **Malachar the Betrayer**, a trusted archmage, opened a **Void Rift** attempting to gain immortality. The rift unleashed **Void Corruption** across the land, twisting creatures and corrupting magic. Alderan sacrificed himself to seal most of the rift, but his action shattered the dynasty.

### Present Day

The world is fractured into competing factions. The Void Rift grows stronger. Ancient evils awaken. Heroes (players) arrive through mystical summoning, prophesied to either save Emberveil or witness its final destruction.

### Major Story Arcs

1. **The Prophecy of Heroes** - Player awakening and early adventures
2. **Fragments of Power** - Collecting Alderan's scattered artifacts
3. **Dragon's Legacy** - Awakening the Dragon Lords
4. **Shadow Wars** - Fighting demon invasions
5. **Mysteries of the Ancients** - Uncovering pre-cataclysm secrets
6. **The Void King** - Final confrontation (endgame)
