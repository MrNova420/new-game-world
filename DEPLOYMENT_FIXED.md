## 🚀 Quick Start (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrNova420/web-game-dev.git
cd web-game-dev
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Game
```bash
npm start
```

That's it! The game will:
1. Build automatically
2. Start the multiplayer server
3. Show you all the URLs to access it

**Access the game at:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 📖 All Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Full Deployment (Recommended)
**Best for:** Playing the complete game with multiplayer

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run deploy
```

What it does:
- Builds the game for production
- Starts multiplayer server on port 3000
- Shows network URLs for friends to join
- Validates all game features
- Creates quick start guide

### Method 2: Development Mode
**Best for:** Development with hot reload

```bash
npm run dev
```

What it does:
- Starts Vite dev server on port 5173
- Hot module replacement (instant updates)
- No multiplayer (single player only)

### Method 3: Development + Multiplayer
**Best for:** Testing multiplayer during development

```bash
npm run multiplayer:dev
```

What it does:
- Runs dev server (port 5173)
- Runs multiplayer server (port 3000)
- Both with hot reload

### Method 4: Production Build Only
**Best for:** Building for deployment elsewhere

```bash
npm run build
```

What it does:
- Creates optimized production build in `dist/` folder
- Ready to deploy to any static host

### Method 5: Multiplayer Server Only
**Best for:** Running just the backend server

```bash
npm run multiplayer
```

What it does:
- Starts multiplayer server on port 3000
- Serves pre-built game from `dist/` folder

## 🌐 Accessing the Game

### Local Access (Your Computer)
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Network Access (Friends on Same WiFi)
The deployment script will show your network IP, for example:
- `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

Share this URL with friends on the same network to play together!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "vite: not found"
**Solution:** Install dependencies first
```bash
npm install
```

### Issue: "Cannot find package 'vite'"
**Solution:** Install vite globally or locally
```bash
npm install
# or globally
npm install -g vite
```

### Issue: "address already in use"
**Solution:** Port 3000 is occupied, kill existing process
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
pkill -f node
# or
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

# On Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Issue: Game loads but stops at "Creating world"
**Solution:** This is now fixed! The world generation is optimized and fast.
- Model loading timeout reduced to 2 seconds
- Parallel loading enabled
- Automatic fallback to procedural generation

### Issue: Server starts but game doesn't load
**Solution:** Make sure you've built the game first
```bash
npm run build
npm run multiplayer
```
