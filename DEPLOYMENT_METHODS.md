## 📊 COMPARISON TABLE

| Method | Build | Server | Validate | Monitor | Speed | Best For |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| `npm start` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Medium | **Production** |
| `npm run deploy:quick` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Fast | Quick testing |
| `npm run multiplayer:dev` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Fastest | Development |
| `npm run serve:wifi` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Fast | WiFi sharing |

---

## ✅ ALL METHODS ARE NOW UNIFIED

**Every deployment method:**
1. ✅ Uses the same server (`multiplayer-server.js`)
2. ✅ Serves the same build (`dist/`)
3. ✅ Shows the same URLs (localhost + network)
4. ✅ Has the same features (multiplayer, 60 FPS, etc.)
5. ✅ Uses the same port (3000)
6. ✅ Has the same performance targets
7. ✅ Is fully updated and tested

**The only differences:**
- **Full deployment** (`npm start`): Includes validation + monitoring
- **Quick deployment** (`npm run deploy:quick`): Skips validation for speed
- **Dev mode** (`npm run dev`): Hot reload for development
