# Dynasty of Emberveil - Game Design Document

## üåå World & Lore

### The Dynasty of Emberveil

The **Dynasty of Emberveil** exists in a permanent twilight - a kingdom suspended between dimensions where reality dissolves into overlapping "Vibespheres." These are realms shaped by pure emotion, color, and consciousness itself.

#### The Collapse

Long ago, the kingdom was ruled by immortal god-kings who communed with the cosmos through burning rare herbs that produced luminous smoke. This smoke was the bridge between worlds, allowing them to harvest **Essence** - the raw matter of consciousness and creation.

But power corrupts, and the god-kings grew greedy. They burned too much, harvested too deep, and tore holes in reality itself. Now the kingdom floats in eternal dusk, and wherever the smoke gathers too thick, dungeons spontaneously manifest - twisted reflections of desires, fears, and forgotten dreams.

### The Wielders

You are a **Wielder** - one of the rare individuals who can navigate the Vibespheres without losing their mind. Your aura literally shapes the world around you, causing dungeons to morph based on your emotional state and fighting style.

### The Essence

**Essence** is everything - it's experience, it's power, it's the currency of existence. Defeated enemies dissolve into pure Essence that you can absorb. The stronger the creature, the more potent their Essence.
